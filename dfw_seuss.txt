The mug has a hair-thin brown crack down one side,
A skinny dog at his side, half in profile.
According to Taylor's use of the word can,
And his thoughts had drifted all over the place,
Bent over and felt the wet grass with his hand.
But I don't really know anything about it.
I'm not sure whether they're called hoofs or feet on swine.
Handcuffed to the corpse of his malevolent foe,
Since for him it would be at worst somewhat dull.
His legs look like he's about to wet himself.
It seemed like it had to have been a bad sign,
Often I was forced to avert my eyes from him,
So fiercely as to incline us to say 'false.'
According to Taylor's use of the word can,
But I don't really know anything about it.
The kind you have to convert and cook up yourself,
Is identical to those worst dreams' form itself:

Or between false and self-contradictory ones,
He spoke very little, just sat up with me.
The bad ankle hasn't ached once this whole year.
The mist of the pool's too-clean smell is in your eyes;
This is awful news.'
Instead of getting sick,
Needs something to make himself dark, in the game.
But that's not what I mean by driving the scene.

Would refute fatalism with respect to the past,
Taylor has not engaged in linguistic reform.
He kept asking them what they were afraid of.
For just three weeks' rental of anything foreign.
Though it's hard to figure out just what they're doing,
And the burly guys manning the road's barricades.
That either Q or Q must fail to occur.
He'd mentioned the child-actor's name over and over.
The sort of man who stands in one place all day.
But born in the hated-by-you Ottawa,
You are merely going with some cosmic flow.
You are merely going with some cosmic flow.
He talks on the phone at the office a lot.
He spoke very little, just sat up with me.
His police lock protruding into empty air,
Mutton stuffed with foie gras, double chocolate rum cake.

She's coming to Cleveland next Friday, it says.
It's just before serious harvesting starts,
Is there anything to say on this subject?

Though it's hard to figure out just what they're doing,
You can tell it's spooky down here in the summer,
The chasm he opened between her and I.
You don't want her facial reaction described.
He spoke very little, just sat up with me.
And it rolls down the floor of the subway,
The dead fields' total snow like a well-ironed sheet,

I don't really drink alcoholic stuff much,
We've been at it maybe an hour and half,
I go Fucking hang up on me why don't you,
And apologized for interrupting his work,
Hard dangerous spirals of brittle black hair.
